# Game-Theory-Solver
This application provides a graphical interface for solving various types of game theory problems. Users can input payoffs for a two-player game and then apply different strategies to analyze the game's properties.


Instructions:
1.	Type of Game:
   
      •	Select either "ZeroSum" or "NonZeroSum" from the dropdown menu to indicate the game type.

2.	Number of Moves:

      •	Enter the number of moves for Player 1 and Player 2 using the provided entry fields.

3.	Enter Payoffs:
   
      •	Click the "Enter Payoffs" button to input the payoffs for each player's moves in the game.

5.	Available Strategies:
   
   •	After entering payoffs, several strategy buttons become available to perform specific game analysis:
  	
      •	Maximin Moves: Determine the maximin move for each player.
  	
      •	Iterated Elimination of Weakly Dominated: Eliminate weakly dominated strategies iteratively.
  	
      •	Iterated Elimination of Strictly Dominated: Eliminate strictly dominated strategies iteratively.
  	
      •	Best Responses: Identify the best responses for both players.
  	
      •	Nash Equilibria: Compute Nash equilibria for the game.
  	
      •	Mixed Strategies: (Under development).
